# web scrapping

Scrapped mobiles data from flipkart website using libraries like BeautifulSoup,requests and then stored all the data in a csv file.  

Now using this csv file , I started cleaning the data to get best results and then worked on  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and concluded with best results.
